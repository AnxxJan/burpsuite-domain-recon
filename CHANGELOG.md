## Migration Guide: 1.x ‚Üí 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

1. **API Migration**
   - Extension now requires Burp Suite 2023.10.3.4 or newer
   - Legacy Extender API code removed completely
   - All HTTP requests now use Montoya API

2. **Removed Features**
   - Security Score column removed from UI and exports
   - Multi-port probing no longer available

3. **Behavioral Changes**
   - WordPress detection issues now have "Information" severity by default
   - Faster scanning with reduced timeouts
   - More conservative network behavior

### Upgrade Steps

1. **Unload old extension** (version 1.x) from Burp Suite
2. **Delete old JAR** from extensions directory
3. **Download new JAR** (domain-recon-2.0.0.jar)
4. **Load extension** in Burp Suite
5. **Verify** Montoya API compatibility (Burp 2023.10+)

### What to Expect

- ‚úÖ Faster scanning performance
- ‚úÖ More stable and reliable
- ‚úÖ Better memory management
- ‚úÖ Enhanced reporting capabilities
- ‚úÖ New vulnerability detection features
- ‚ùå No more security score (was removed)
